# Spark Optimization & Benchmarking

This project shows how I approach **Spark performance tuning**:

- Comparing naive vs. optimized queries
- Using partitioning, caching, and predicate pushdown
- Measuring execution time

## Components

- `src/naive_job.py`: Baseline Spark job.
- `src/optimized_job.py`: Optimized Spark job with tuning.
- `data/`: Sample dataset for local experimentation.

This demonstrates practical, hands-on performance thinking valuable in large-scale environments.
