# AI / ML Governance (LLM + LangChain Patterns)

This project codifies my approach to **AI/ML governance**, focusing on:

- Transparent pipelines (document ingestion → embedding → retrieval → summarization)
- Config-driven controls (e.g., allowed models, rate limits, cost tracking)
- Testability and observability of LLM behaviors

## Key Components

- `src/pipeline.py`: Simplified LangChain-style pipeline (no external calls by default).
- `config/governance.yml`: Example configuration for allowed models and limits.
- `tests/test_policy_enforcement.py`: Ensures governance rules are applied before running an LLM.

This project is designed to signal my ability to implement **AI risk management and policy enforcement**. As a Director, I ensure that our AI initiatives are not only innovative but also compliant, cost-controlled, and ethically governed.
